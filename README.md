#  Windows XP Portfolio

This project is a single-page portfolio designed to emulate the iconic **Windows XP "Bliss" desktop interface**. It serves as a unique and interactive resume/project index built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (dragging windows, taskbar, start menu).

The goal is to provide a nostalgic, engaging environment to explore my technical skills, experience, and projects.

#  Technology Stack

This portfolio is a showcase of front-end fundamentals and system UI emulation:

* **HTML5:** Handles the structure and semantic layout of the application.
* **CSS3:** Provides custom styling for the authentic Windows XP theme, including taskbar design, gradients, buttons, and drop shadows.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Drives the core interactivity, managing functions like window dragging, opening/closing application windows, the dynamic clock, and event handling.
